      <p class="description-content long-description hidden">If you didn't get to see the last total solar eclipse to pass over the US, in August 2017, then you likely have never seen one. There was one in 1979 that just grazed the Northwest of this country. The next one to cross the US won't be until 2045! (Well, one just grazes the Northwest in 2044.) This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see a total solar eclipse in the United States.</p>

    <h2 class="why-come-section-title">How a Total Solar Eclipse Compares with Other Types</h2>
    <p class="centered-section-description">There really is no comparison! Total Solar Eclipse - accept no substitutes.</p>
    <p class="centered-section-description">But just to cover our bases, here's a rundown of the different types of shows in the sky:</p>

        <div class="description-container">
          <p class="description-content short-description" onclick="showLongDescription(this)">The Moon covers only part of the Sun. Not noticable if you don't know to look (with eclipse glasses!)</p>
          <p class="description-content long-description hidden">This is the most common type of solar eclipse, happening somewhere on earth around two times per year. Most of the country will experience this on April 8th, as every Total Solar Eclipse is a Partial for those outside the path of totality. During a Partial you can't notice any change to the Sun if you were to glance quickly at it. And this is not advised, as the Sun's rays are too strong for your eyes to handle, even when the Sun is mostly covered by the Moon. In places near the path of totality, changes to the intensity and character of the daylight can happen, but they will be more pronounced in the path of totality during the lead up to totality.</p>

          <p class="description-content short-description" onclick="showLongDescription(this)">The Moon covers the Sun's center. This makes for quite a sight - but only with eclipse glasses.</p>
          <p class="description-content long-description hidden">In this type, the Moon covers the Sun's center, leaving the Sun's outer edges to form a "ring of fire" around the Moon, called an annulus. There is only partial coverage because the Sun-Moon-Earth alignment is happening at a time when the Moon is a bit farther from the Earth than it is during a total solar eclipse. Like a partial solar eclipse, this type cannot be observed with the naked eye at any point. There was an annular solar eclipse this past October which was visible in parts of the southwest US. The spectacular imagery you can find online of a ring of fire hovering over the landscape can only be acheived with special camera equipment.</p>

          <p class="description-content long-description hidden">During a total solar eclipse there is all the fun of a partial solar eclipse, plus more. In the run up to the minutes of totality, the daylight changes in intensity and character, and the temperature drops. Animals sense that night is falling and either head home to roost or come out for action, in the case of animals that are active at twilight. At the preordained moment, the Moon moves into position to completely cover the face of the Sun, allowing you to remove your eclipse glasses and peer up at the Sun and Moon with the naked eye. You'll notice something peeking out from behind the Moon - the Sun's wispy outer atmosphere, called the corona. The sky is now very dark, as if it were early night, and you can see the brighter stars and planets. Enjoy this spectacular moment while it lasts, which this time around will be for 4 minutes or more!</p>

          <p class="description-content long-description hidden">A lunar eclipse is caused by a different arrangment than solar eclipses. Here the Earth is positioned between the Sun and the Moon and its shadow falls on the Moon. This can only happen during a full Moon, and it can happen more than once in a year. The Earth's shadow is much larger than the Moon, so a lunar eclipse can last for a few hours. The Moon can turn a deep red color during a total lunar eclipse, which is why it is sometimes called a "Blood Moon". This red light cast on the Moon can be thought of as the light of all the sunsets and sunrises happening around the Earth at that moment, cast upon the face of the Moon!</p>

    <p class="centered-section-description">There's more to a total solar eclipse than simply seeing that classic image of the Sun's wispy corona peeking out from behind the Moon, as spectacular as that can be. There's the 360ยบ dusk light, as if the sunset were happening in every direction at once. All the wildlife and farm animals will notice something strange is happening as the shadow approaches. Despite the time of day, it appears as though the Sun is quickly setting. Critters scurry and fly home to their roosts.</p>
