    <p class="centered-section-description">1.5 million acres of beautiful public land spread out over 29 counties in the Ozark Highlands</p>
    <p class="centered-section-description">The Forest is characterized by large permanent springs, caves, rocky barren glades, old volcanic mountains and nationally-recognized streams.</p>
    <p class="centered-section-description">The North East corner of Oregon County is blanketed by 17,000 acres of its Eleven Point ranger district</p>
    <p class="centered-section-description">There are hundreds of miles of both trails for hiking and rivers for kayaking/canoeing throughout the Forest. This includes Oregon County's pristine Eleven Point River...</p>

    <p class="centered-section-description">The Eleven Point river has been preserved as a National Wild & Scenic River since the establishment of that system in 1968.</p>
    <p class="centered-section-description">Numerous springs pour into the river from dolomite bluffs or up from vast underground systems.</p>
    <p class="centered-section-description">It is a popular spot for kayaking and canoeing, fishing, and camping. Many fish and a variety of animals can be spotted here. Look for otters swimming and bald eagles soaring overhead.</p>
    <p class="centered-section-description">The Eleven Point is unique in the region due to its low use, the pristine water, and the lack of development along the river corridor.</p>

          <p class="description-content long-description hidden">This is the most common type of solar eclipse, happening somewhere on earth around two times per year. Most of the country will experience this on April 8th, as every Total Solar Eclipse is a Partial for those outside the path of totality. During a Partial you can't notice any change to the Sun if you were to glance quickly at it. And this is not advised, as the Sun's rays are too strong for your eyes to handle, even when the Sun is mostly covered by the Moon. In places near the path of totality, changes to the intensity and character of the daylight can happen, but they will be more pronounced in the path of totality during the lead up to totality.</p>
