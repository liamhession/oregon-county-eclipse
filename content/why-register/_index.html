    <h1>Why Register</h1>
    <h3>Wondering what we're up to here?</h3>
    <p class="centered-section-description big">Our rural county never sees an influx of visitors like is expected for the Eclipse. Folks can't wrap their head around just how many people will be coming.</p>
    <p class="centered-section-description big">Register to help us tally up a visitor headcount. It gives our restaurants and other businesses a better idea of how much they need to stock up.</p>
    <p class="centered-section-description big">It benefits you too - it could save you from showing up at a restaurant you had your eye on, only to find out they've run out. Plus on our headcounts page you can see how many people plan on eating at each restaurant on a given day, down to the hour, which can help you avoid the rush.</p>
    <p class="centered-section-description big">Also, many organizations and individuals want to know it will be worth going big with the fun events that they have planned. They don't have the time to advertise these widely. Your registration means one more person who can be reached about all the amazing goings-on, even if they come together last-minute.</p>
    <p class="centered-section-description big">Expect a weekly digest of new info that's been added here, and more like daily emails in the week leading up to the Eclipse as more logistical nuts and bolts become known.</p>
    <p class="centered-section-description big">So go ahead and <a href="/signup">Register</a> to stay in the loop</p>
    <p class="centered-section-description big">If you still have some questions just <a href="/contact-us.html">reach out</a>!</p>
