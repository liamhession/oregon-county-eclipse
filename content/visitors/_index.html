    <p class="centered-section-description">Here are some tips to help you make the most of your visit to the area for the eclipse.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Ways To Stay</h2>

    <h3>Camping Gear Rental</h3>
    <p class="centered-section-description">If you will be flying in for the eclipse you might like to have a tent, sleeping bag, and sleeping pad provided for you that weekend. You can rent this Camping Gear package for $150, and use it for as many nights as you're here. Just <a href="/a/tent">submit this form</a> to make a reservation with no commitment - you will pay on site when you pick up the gear. If you choose to bring any of your own items just let us know at that time for a discount. Finally, if you should decide you liked the gear, your rental fee can be applied toward the purchase price. Just pay the difference and the shipping fee and we will have it sent to your home.</p>

    <h3>Dispersed Camping On Public Lands</h3>
    <p class="centered-section-description">For those folks not afraid to camp without amenities like toilets and showers. Dispersed camping is allowed throughout the Mark Twain National Forest, which includes sites near the Eleven Point River. It is important that you follow Leave No Trace principles and pack out everything.</p>
    <p class="centered-section-description">The advantages of going this route are not needing to reserve anything in advance, and it's free.</p>

    <h3>Camping with Amenities</h3>
    <p class="centered-section-description">There are campsites that are first-come-first-served, and there is an eclipse festival of sorts being operated by some locals.</p>

    <h3>Rentals (Airbnb etc.)</h3>
    <p class="centered-section-description">There are limited options for full-weekend rentals at this point. However, many of the local Airbnbs and Vrbos are actually only rented for Sunday night, the night before the eclipse. This means if you're okay with some added logistics, you can do a two-stage stay. First, get a cushy place to be your home base for exploring the area on Friday and Saturday. Then, on Sunday you'd switch to camping somewhere. See above for suggestions on that, including info on how you can rent camping essentials.</p>
    <p class="centered-section-description">The organizer behind this website would also be happy to host some campers on his land near Alton on the nights of 4/7 and 4/8. Reach out through our contact form.</p>
    <p class="centered-section-description">Here are some links to browse rentals in our area that are available for your first two nights:</p>

    <h3>Hotels</h3>
    <p class="centered-section-description">The nearest city with a few hotels is West Plains. It's a 45min - 1hr drive from West Plains to some of the natural attractions of Oregon County that will make for great viewing locations. If you're seeing a lack of rooms over the weekend, you can try the same strategy mentioned above for Airbnbs - you'll see more availability if you try to book for Friday and/or Saturday nights. And then you'd camp out directly in the path of the eclipse on Sunday night. (See above for info on renting camping equipment.) There are also hotels in some of the other nearby towns, but they have even less availability even for Friday and Saturday night, though you can check.</p>

  <div class="page-section">
    <h2 class="section-title">Stay Monday Night, Post-Eclipse</h2>
    <p class="centered-section-description">Most people will leave after the eclipse, so if you stay Monday night, you won't have to contend with the crush of traffic heading back towards the major cities and airports. In 2017 groups that traveled from Chicago down to southern Illinois to watch the eclipse spent 9 hours driving home, when normally it would take 4. Also, if you stay you'll have the place to yourself and can enjoy the area without the crowds.</p>

  <div class="page-section">
    <h2 class="section-title">Get To Your Viewing Site Early</h2>
    <p class="centered-section-description">The first stages of the eclipse will begin 1 hour and 15 minutes before totality. So if your car is parked and you're settling in, you'll have time to check out the projection of the sun with your pinhole "projector" and take a look at it with your eclipse glasses on. <a href="/glasses.html">Purchase your commemorative pair here!</a></p>
