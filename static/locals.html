      <h1>Wondering how you can help make our county's Eclipse experience as amazing as possible?</h1>

      <div class="locals-section-header">Inviting Family and Friends</div>
      <div class="locals-section-text">
        <p>Bringing more folks to our area for the Eclipse should start with those people we are connected with. If a friend or some part of the family has been talking about coming out your way soon but it just hasn't happened yet, the Eclipse is the perfect excuse!</p>
        <p>There won't be anyother Total Solar Eclipse passing over any part of the US until 2044, and it will be millenia before another one comes to our area.</p>
        <p>Tell your loved ones that a rural and very natural county such as ours is an ideal place to witness the way animals react to the falling darkness of the Eclipse.</p>
        <p>And once they've decided to come out, point them to <a href="oregoncountyeclipse.com/signup">our signup page for visitors</a> so that they can plan their trip here and snag some promos!</p>

      <div class="locals-section-header">Hosting Campers on your Land with Hipcamp</div>
      <div class="locals-section-text">
        <p>Do you have a large yard or some other open space on your property? If so, you can make some extra money by hosting campers on your land through Hipcamp.</p>
        <p>Hipcamp is a website that connects campers with landowners who are willing to host them. It's like Airbnb, but for camping.</p>
        <p>Hosting campers on your land is a great way to make some extra money, and it's also a great way to meet new people and make new friends.</p>
        <p>Your Hipcamp guests will be a great potential source of customers for our businesses. For guidance on what they can see and do while here, point them to <a href="oregoncountyeclipse.com/signup">our signup page for visitors</a> to help them plan their visit and reserve promos!</p>
