        <h3>Commemorative Oregon County Eclipse Glasses</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
              <span>Purchase all the pairs you'll need now, and save compared to buying last-minute! Pay now, and then swing by Alton on your chosen day to pick up the glasses you paid for.&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p>
              <span>The Official Oregon County Eclipse glasses feature a handy list of the precise times that Totality starts and ends for the 4 main towns in the county. The&nbsp;design also depicts a forest scene of early spring along the Eleven Point River, with a couple of redbud trees standing out among the dormant oaks. Redbud artwork by local artist Dez Fleck.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
              <span>Proceeds go to fund the Alton Area Chamber of Commerce, a 501(c)(3) non-profit that serves the local community's businesses and people.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
              <span>The Chamber's design was printed onto these glasses by Rainbow Symphony. Their glasses meet all the relevant eye safety standards, and are recommended by the American Astronomical Society. You can read more details at </span>
